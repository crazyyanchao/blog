# Memory settings recommendation from neo4j-admin memrec:
#
# Assuming the system is dedicated to running Neo4j and has 126100m of memory,
# we recommend a heap size of around 31200m, and a page cache of around 78800m,
# and that about 16100m is left for the operating system, and the native memory
# needed by Lucene and Netty.
#
# Tip: If the indexing storage use is high, e.g. there are many indexes or most
# data indexed, then it might advantageous to leave more memory for the
# operating system.
#
# Tip: The more concurrent transactions your workload has and the more updates
# they do, the more heap memory you will need. However, don't allocate more
# than 31g of heap, since this will disable pointer compression, also known as
# "compressed oops", in the JVM and make less effective use of the heap.
#
# Tip: Setting the initial and the max heap size to the same value means the
# JVM will never need to change the heap size. Changing the heap size otherwise
# involves a full GC, which is desirable to avoid.
#
# Based on the above, the following memory settings are recommended:
